# Small Group Project

A website for small groups to use to easily access each other's information and event dates.

## Challenges

### General

- I may have gotten too eager to learn NextJS
  - Being fairly fresh out of my coding bootcamp where we were introduced to React and Redux on the front-end and Node, Express, and Knex on the back-end, I jumped in to a world that I didn't realize flipped everything upside down. Having to translate stuff that was still fresh and not fully understood into a new way of doing things caused the learning process to be a bit slower than I had hoped.
  - However, I think it also sped up my learning ability, problem-solving, and language translation.

### Backend

- Before this project my only experience with databases was using SQLite, Knex, and Express.
- I wanted to build a fullstack project using NextJS but was unfamiliar with PostgreSQL and Vercel Postgres.
- I followed tutorials to build and seed my database. There was tons of trial and error. Eventually I decided to install Knex and realized it helped make then process a lot easier to understand; especially with the addition of migrations and rollbacks.
